	<h1>Custom Searches</h1>
	<p>Custom searches you can add to your browser.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://tenbluelinks.org/">&amp;udm=14</a></p>
			<p>Page contains instructions that can also be followed for other custom searches listed here.</p>
			<p>A web-only search, it's the same as if you do a Google search then, under More, choose "Web." It excludes AI Overview but also many other features of the default "All" search (featured snippets, "People also ask," listing Videos that match, etc.).</p>
